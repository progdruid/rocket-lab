# rocket-lab
This is an extremely simple "game" written in an own extremely simple engine.

* It does all the physics on its own.
* The render "engine" uses [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx).
* It uses [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) for windowing.
* It was explicitly told to use DirectX12, but you can change it to whatever API you want, as long as this API can be initialised in GLFW window.

This project was made by me for Computer Games Technology BSc course at Abertay University on Year 1, Semester 1.
